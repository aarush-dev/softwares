WEATHER MULTIPLIER,,,"This multiplier is applied according to what the curve is…there is no effect on straight stretches and maximum affect on curvy parts.. For example if your multiplier is 0.30 and the curve is 0 then the speed doesn't change at all, at a curve of 128 (half of the scale), then the speed is multiplied by 0.15, and if the curve is 256 (max) then the curve is multiplied by 0.30....get it ",,,,,,
