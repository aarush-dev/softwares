; This template is provided to make sure all controls share similar functionality.

; will be treated as custom states.

; Only include hover if you support it, as it would cause a unneccisary performance hit otherwise.
; The rest of the states should be included even if they are not currently used to allow the possibility
; of extra functionality in the future.
